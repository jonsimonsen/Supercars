# Supercars
A small top down racing game without scrolling

# Implementation
The game is being programmed in Python, using the PyGame library

# Running
Run from terminal by navigating to the folder containing the py files and typing: <br />
  python game.py <br /> <br />
Use the arrow keys to control the car. <br />
  
# Customization
It is possible to change some of the characteristics of the game by altering config.py. <br />
Be aware that some changes can mess up the game to a certain degree, <br />
and that lap times will not necessarily be comparable before and after. <br />

# History
v0_1: </br>
  -It's possible to drive a car-like shape around in the window.  </br>
  
v0_2: </br>
  -Added asphalt, grass and obstacles. </br>
  -The car rebounds when hitting obstacles and game screen boundaries. </br>
  -The physics of collisions are not quite realistic (mainly the "reflection angle"). </br>
  -Added checkpoints that the player must visit in the correct order to finish a lap. </br>
  -Added a menu that displays laps left, best laptime, and latest lap time. </br>
  
Issues: </br>
  -No mechanism ends the race when there are no laps left. </br>
  -Total time used is not displayed. </br>
  -No highscore functionality exists. </br>
  -Can improve game physics. </br>
  -Can implement more tracks. </br>
  -Can implement opposition. </br>
  -The code can be cleaned up. </br>
  -The vector library or a replacement could be included. </br>
  
v0_25: </br>
  -Added total time to the menu. </br>
  -Received permission to upload a Vector library that allows the game to actually be played (precode.py). </br>
  
v0_3: </br>
  -Cleaned up the code considerably. </br>
  -The race ends with a small delay after the last lap has been finished. </br>
  -Removed some outdated info from this document. </br>
  
Issues: </br>
  -highscore, better game physics, more tracks, opponents
