# Supercars
Planning to make a small top down racing game without scrolling

# Implementation
The game is being programmed in Python, using the PyGame library

# Information
The game cannot be run currently. One of the necessary libraries will possibly not be uploaded until I've clarified with the author that it's ok. </br>
In either case, the game so far involves being able to drive a shape that resembles a car around in an otherwise empty window. </br>

# History
v0_1: </br>
  -It's possible to drive a car-like shape around in the window.  </br>
  
v0_2: </br>
  -Added asphalt, grass and obstacles. </br>
  -The car rebounds when hitting obstacles and game screen boundaries. </br>
  -The physics of collisions are not quite realistic (mainly the "reflection angle"). </br>
  -Added checkpoints that the player must visit in the correct order to finish a lap. </br>
  -Added a menu that displays laps left, best laptime, and latest lap time. </br>
  
Issues: </br>
  -No mechanism ends the race when there are no laps left. </br>
  -Total time used is not displayed. </br>
  -No highscore functionality exists. </br>
  -Can improve game physics. </br>
  -Can implement more tracks. </br>
  -Can implement opposition. </br>
  -The code can be cleaned up. </br>
  -The vector library or a replacement could be included. </br>
