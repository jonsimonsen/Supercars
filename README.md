# Supercars
Planning to make a small top down racing game without scrolling

# Implementation
The game is being programmed in Python, using the PyGame library

# Information
The game cannot be run currently. One of the necessary libraries will possibly not be uploaded until I've clarified with the author that it's ok. </br>
In either case, the game so far involves being able to drive a shape that resembles a car around in an otherwise empty window. </br>
